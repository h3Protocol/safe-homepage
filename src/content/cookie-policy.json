Such information tells us about the pages you are clicking on or the hardware you are using, but not your name, age, address or anything we can use to identify you personally. We exclusively process your personal data in pseudonymised form.<br/> This Cookie Policy applies to our website at <a href=\"https://safe.global\">https://safe.global</a> and sets out some further detail on how and why we use these technologies on our website. In this policy, \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refers to Safe Ecosystem Foundation, a foundation incorporated in Switzerland with its registered office at <strong>Safe Ecosystem Foundation, Bahnhofstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland</strong>. The terms “you” and “your” includes our clients, business partners and users of this website.<br/> By using our website, you consent to storage and access to cookies and other technologies on your device, in accordance with this Cookie Policy.<h2>What are cookies?</h2><p>Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer or device used to access a website. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p><h2>What are the different types of cookies?</h2><p>A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs. By lifespan, a cookie is either a:<ol><li>session cookie which is erased when the user closes the browser; or</li><li>persistent cookie which is saved to the hard drive and remains on the user's computer/device for a pre-defined period of time.</li></ol>As for the domain to which it belongs, cookies are either:<ol><li>first-party cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (i.e. set by us); or</li><li>third-party cookies stored by a different domain to the visited page's domain.</li></ol></p><h2>What cookies do we use and why?</h2><p>We list all the cookies we use on this website in the APPENDIX below.<br/>We do not use cookies set by ourselves via our web developers (first-party cookies). We only have those set by others (third-party cookies).<br/>Cookies are also sometimes classified by reference to their purpose. We use the following cookies for the following purposes:<ol><li>Analytical/performance cookies: They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it, as well as dates and times they visit. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li><li>Targeting cookies: These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed, as well as time spent on our website, and the websites visited just before and just after our website. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.</li></ol><br/>In general, we use cookies and other technologies (such as web server logs) on our website to enhance your experience and to collect information about how our website is used.<br/> We will retain and evaluate information on your recent visits to our website and how you move around different sections of our website for analytics purposes to understand how people use our website so that we can make it more intuitive. The information also helps us to understand which parts of this website are most popular and generally to assess user behavior and characteristics to measure interest in and use of the various areas of our website. This then allows us to improve our website and the way we market our business.<br/>This information may also be used to help us to improve, administer and diagnose problems with our server and website. The information also helps us monitor traffic on our website so that we can manage our website's capacity and efficiency.</p><h2>Other Technologies</h2><p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf. In addition to the uses of cookies described above, these entities may use other methods, such as the technologies described below, to collect information about your use of our website and other websites and online services.<br/>Pixels tags. Pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels), are small pieces of code that can be embedded on websites and emails. Pixels tags may be used to learn how you interact with our website pages and emails, and this information helps us, and our partners provide you with a more tailored experience.<br/>Device Identifiers. A device identifier is a unique label that can be used to identify a mobile device. Device identifiers may be used to track, analyze and improve the performance of the website and ads delivered.</p><h2>What data is collected by cookies and other technologies on our website?</h2><p><strong>This information may include:</strong><ol><li> the IP and logical address of the server you are using (but the last digits are anonymised so we cannot identify you)</li><li>the top level domain name from which you access the internet (for example .ie, .com, etc)</li><li>the type of browser you are using</li><li>the date and time you access our website</li><li>the internet address linking to our website</li></ol></p><p><strong>This website also uses cookies to:</strong><ol><li>remember you and your actions while navigating between pages;</li><li>remember if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on our website;</li><li>ensure the security of the website;</li><li>monitor and improve the performance of servers hosting the site;</li><li>distinguish users and sessions;</li><li>improving the speed of the site when you access content repeatedly;</li><li>determine new sessions and visits;</li><li>show the traffic source or campaign that explains how you may have reached our website; and</li> <li>allow us to store any customization preferences where our website allows this</li></ol>We may also use other services, such as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/\">Hotjar</a> (described below) or other third-party cookies, to assist with analyzing performance on our website. As part of providing these services, these service providers may use cookies and the technologies described below to collect and store information about your device, such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of our website, links clicked and conversion information, IP address, browser, mobile network information, and type of operating system used.</p><p><strong>Google Analytics Cookies</strong><br/>This website uses <a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a>, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\"Google\").<br/>We use Google Analytics to track your preferences and also to identify popular sections of our website. Use of Google Analytics in this way, enables us to adapt the content of our website more specifically to your needs and thereby improve what we can offer to you.<br/>Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

In such an example Google will analyze the number of users for us, but the relevant cookies do not reveal their identities.<br/>By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
