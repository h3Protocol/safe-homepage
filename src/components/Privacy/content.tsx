            <strong>2. Your information and the Blockchain</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), is at the core of our
            business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called
            ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very
            difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several
            ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or
            otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no
            centralized place where it is located either.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, by design, a blockchains records cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be ‘immutable’.
            This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be
            forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing, of your personal data. Data on the blockchain
            cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access
            rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of
            tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your wallet address, onto the
            blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your
            wallet’s private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the blockchain using your wallet address, as well as
            (ii) share the public key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON
            BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE
            TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND
            ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

            <strong>3. How We Use Personal Data</strong>
          </p>
          <p>3.1. When visiting our website</p>
          <p>We may collect and process Personal Data about your use of our website. This data may include:</p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'lower-roman' }}>
            <li>the browser types and versions used;</li>
            <li>the operating system used by the accessing system;</li>
            <li>the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers);</li>
            <li>behaviour: subpage, duration, and revisit</li>
            <li>the date and time of access to our website,</li>
            <li>the Internet protocol address (“IP address”);</li>
            <li>the Internet service provider of the accessing system; and</li>
            <li>
              any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
              technology systems.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This data may be processed in order to deliver the content of our website correctly, to optimize the content
            of our website to ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website
            technology, and to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
            prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate business interests, namely monitoring and improving
            our website and the proper protection of our business against risks and your consent when agreeing to accept
            cookies
          </p>
          <p>3.2. When using the Safe App, the Safe for teams edition or the browser extension</p>
          <p>
            When using the Safe App, the Safe for teams or the browser extension we may collect and process personal
            data. The data will be stored in different instances.
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'lower-latin' }}>
            <li>
              <p>On the Blockchain the following data will be stored:</p>
              <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'lower-roman' }}>
                <li>your smart contract address of the Safe;</li>

                <li>ETH and token balance.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The data is needed to create the user’s safe and enable the user to make use of the app. The Gnosis Safe
                is a multi-signature wallet. Thus, the externally owned accounts are needed to confirm a transaction
                before they are executed.
              </p>
              <p>The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfil a contract with you.</p>
              <p>
                The data will be stored on the Blockchain. Given the technological design of the blockchain, as
                explained in section 2, this data will become public and it will not likely be possible to delete or
                change the data at any given time.

              </ol>
              <p>
                We need this data to be able to debug issues and provide support for our application. The legal basis
                for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfil a contract with you.

          </ol>
          <p>
            In addition, we may take a recording of you while testing the Safe for internal and external use. The basis
            for this collection and processing is our legitimate business interest in monitoring and improving our
            services.

            <strong>4. Use of Third Party Applications</strong>
          </p>
          <p>4.1. Blockchain</p>
          <p>
            When using the Gnosis Safe your smart contract address, the transactions made with the Safe, addresses of
            externally owned accounts and ETH balances and token balances will be stored on the Blockchain. See section
            2 of this Policy
          </p>
          <p>
            The information will be displayed permanently and public, this is part of the nature of the blockchain.
            <br />
            If you are new to this field, we highly recommend informing yourself about the blockchain technology before
            using our services.
          </p>
          <p>4.2. Amazon Webserver</p>
          <p>We use the Amazon Web Server (AWS) to store log and database data as described in section 3.2</p>
          <p>
            For further information and the applicable data protection provisions of AWS please visit{' '}

          <p>4.3. Appstore /Playstore/Chrome Webstore</p>
          <p>
            Apple and Google most likely track user behavior when downloading apps from their stores as well as when
            using apps. We (Gnosis) only have very limited access to that data. We can view aggregated statistics on
            installs and uninstalls. Grouping by device type, app version, language, carrier and country is possible.

          <p>4.4. Fingerprint/Touch ID/ Face ID</p>
          <p>
            We enable the user to unlock the Safe mobile app via fingerprint/ touch ID (Android and iOS) and Face ID
            (iPhone X). This is a feature of the operating system. We do not store any of this data. Instead, a
            proprietary API of the operating system is used to validate the user input. If you have any further
            questions regarding fingerprint/ touch ID/ face ID you should consult with your preferred mobile device
            provider or manufacturer.
          </p>
          <p>4.5. Firebase</p>
          <p>
            We use Firebase in order to be able to create reports and user funnels to understand possible issues of our
            app that might impair user experience. We also need the to access this information to track the success of
            our product. The Data is collected and stored by Firebase.
          </p>
          <p>The total data collected by firebase is compiled under the following link:</p>

            you have any further questions you can contact us on the above details.
          </p>
          <p>Right to rectification</p>
          <p>
            You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any
            incomplete personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of
            that information. The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you do not want us to use your
            Personal Information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or need to advise us of any changes to
            your personal information, or would like any more information about the way in which we collect and use your
            Personal Information, please contact us at the above details.
          </p>
          <p>Right to erasure (right to be ‘forgotten’)</p>
          <p>
            You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following
            circumstances:
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected;</li>
            <li>
              you withdraw your consent to consent based processing and no other legal justification for processing
              applies;
            </li>
            <li>you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;</li>
            <li>we unlawfully processed your personal information; and</li>
            <li>erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            However, when interacting with the blockchain we may not be able to ensure that your personal data is
            deleted. This is because the blockchain is a public decentralized network and blockchain technology does not
            generally allow for data to be deleted and your right to erasure may not be able to be fully enforced. In
            these circumstances we will only be able to ensure that all personal data that is held by us is permanently
            deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
            <li>Complying with a legal obligation under EU or other applicable law;</li>
            <li>The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
            <li>
              Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical
              purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
            </li>
            <li>The establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing</p>
          <p>You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:</p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>you contest the accuracy of the personal information;</li>
            <li>
              where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of
              the unlawfully processed personal information;
            </li>
            <li>
              we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the
              establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances,
            such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the
            services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when interacting with the blockchain, as it is a public decentralized network, we will likely not
            be able to prevent external parties from processing any personal data which has been written onto the
            blockchain. In these circumstances we will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that all processing of
            personal data held by us is restricted, notwithstanding this, your right to restrict to processing may not
            be able to be fully enforced.
          </p>
          <p>Right to data portability</p>
          <p>
            Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent or the processing is necessary for the performance
            of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a
            contract, you have a right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly
            used and machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.
          </p>
          <p>Right to freedom from automated decision-making</p>
          <p>
            As explained above, we do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes
            place, you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as
            request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based
            on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.
          </p>
          <p>Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)</p>
          <p>
            You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. We will not contact you for
            marketing purposes unless:
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>
              you have a business relationship with us, and we rely on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for
              processing (as described above)
            </li>
            <li>you have otherwise given your prior consent (such as when you download one of our guides)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us on the above details. On each and
            every marketing communication, we will always provide the option for you to exercise your right to object to
            the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (known as ‘opting-out’) by clicking on the
            ‘unsubscribe’ button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we use to
            collect your data. You may also opt-out at any time by contacting us on the below details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you
            of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our
            clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as
            they are necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to
            opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you
            regarding your use of our website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.
          </p>
          <p>Right to request access</p>
          <p>
            You also have a right to access information we hold about you. We are happy to provide you with details of
            your Personal Information that we hold or process. To protect your personal information, we follow set
            storage and disclosure procedures, which mean that we will require proof of identity from you prior to
            disclosing such information. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us on the above details.
          </p>
          <p>Right to withdraw consent</p>
          <p>
            Where the legal basis for processing your personal information is your consent, you have the right to
            withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us on the above details.
          </p>
          <p>Raising a complaint about how we have handled your personal data</p>

          <p>Right to lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory authority</p>
